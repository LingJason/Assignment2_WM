# WB Assignment2
Use Python and any framework(Django) to design and create APIs. The APIs will need to connect to the database, please use MySql.

Let’s say we are creating a product to manage the rental data. We have maybe more than one renter in one rental property, and one rental property is owned by a landlord. The renter will need to provide their name, telephone number, email address and gender. The landlord will need to provide their name, telephone number, email address and address, postal code, property type(single house, townhouse, apartment) and rent price of the property. 

Please design and create a UML class diagram based on the above information. Don’t need to create them in the database, but please create a table in the MySql database to hold the renter’s data for later use.
Create an API to create, update and delete the renter data in the database.
